                <h1>Bengal</h1>
                <h2>Originated in California</h2>
                <p>Bengal cats descended from domestic cats and wild Asian leopard cats. They are an intelligent and active breed prized for their boldly patterned coats. Bengal cats are a spectacular breed that sports a spotted or marbled coat that looks a lot like a wild leopard or ocelot. But the Bengal is anything but wild and has a loving, affectionate personality. While Bengals were developed by breeding domestic felines to an Asian leopard cat, their wild natures have long been abandoned. Bengal cats are a lithe and agile breed and generally weigh between 8–15 pounds. They're prized for their dense, short coats that are boldly patterned in different shades of brown, silver, and snow. Their fur is super soft to the touch, feeling a bit like bunny hair. The most common eye colors found in Bengal cats are brown, yellow, orange, and green.</p>

                <h1>Persian</h1>
                <h2>Originated in Persia</h2>
                <p>The Persian cat has been cherished for hundreds—if not thousands—of years, tracing their origins to the deserts of Persia and Iran. The Persian cat is a medium- to large-sized breed, easily identifiable by their round, flat face and long, flowing coats that come in almost every color. Persian cats are gentle, loving companions even if their face makes them look a little grumpy. The Persian cat is known and loved for their very sweet, gentle, calm disposition. Though Persian cats are quite friendly, they require gentle handling, which means no roughhousing or grabbing from young children. They get along great with kind, respectful kids, but would rather be stroked and admired than engage in strenuous activities. Persians also enjoy the company of other cats and gentle dogs if they are introduced properly. Persians love to sprawl out in their favorite spot in the home with good vantage points to keep an eye on the goings-on in the household, be it a plush chair or atop a cat tree. Persians are homebodies. It’s best to keep them indoors to prevent overheating or tangling up their profuse, long coats. Persian cats love their human families, but they don’t mind being left alone for short periods of time as long as they are in their own homes where they feel comfortable and safe. Persians are fairly easy to care for in terms of exercise and mental stimulation (a few play sessions a day will do just fine), but their coat requires extensive care and is not for the faint of heart. If not properly cared for, the Persian's coat can form mats, which are extremely painful for cats. The Persian cat’s luxurious, flowing coat requires a lot of grooming—perhaps the most in all of the cat kingdom. To prevent mats from forming, a Persian cat needs daily combing with a wide-toothed metal comb, followed by daily brushing with a soft slicker brush. When combing, Persian cat owners must take care to part the hair and ensure they are combing all the way down to the skin, or mats will sneakily form underneath the long hair.
